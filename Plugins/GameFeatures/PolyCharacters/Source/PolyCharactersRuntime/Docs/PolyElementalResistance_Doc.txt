PolyElementalResistance – Damage Type Resistances
=================================================

- Feeds PolyDamageExecution to reduce incoming damage based on damage type.

Key Attributes
- ResistRadiation, ResistIncendiary, ResistShock, ResistFreeze, ResistPoison, ResistNanite.
- Clamp: 0..1 for all resistances.
- Replicated with OnRep per attribute.

Component Integration
- PolyElementalResistanceComponent binds attribute change delegates for UI/AI and exposes getters.
- Initialize with ASC; requires the set present on the ASC (EnsurePolyAttributeSets).

Usage
- Set baseline resistances via GameplayEffects.
- Apply elemental damage GEs with PolyDamageExecution and one Poly.Damage.* tag; execution reads the matching resistance and applies (1 - resist) to incoming damage.
