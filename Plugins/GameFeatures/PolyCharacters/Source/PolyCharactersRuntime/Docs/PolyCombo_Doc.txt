PolyComboComponent – Combo Tracking (Server-Driven)
==================================================

Purpose
- Track successive hits within a time window. Increments on hits, resets after a timeout with no hits.
- Expose events for UI/logic to react to combo changes or resets.

Location
- Component: Public/Character/PolyComboComponent.h, Private/Character/PolyComboComponent.cpp

Core fields
- ComboCount: current chain length.
- LastHitTime: time (seconds) of the last registered hit.
- ComboTimeout: max idle time (seconds) before the combo resets (default 2.0).
- MaxComboRecorded: highest combo observed (for UI/telemetry).

API
- RegisterHit(HitTimeSeconds = -1, MinDamageThreshold = 0, DamageAmount = 0):
  - Call from your hit/damage logic (server-side). If DamageAmount < MinDamageThreshold, it ignores the hit.
  - If the combo already timed out, it resets before incrementing.
  - Increments ComboCount, updates LastHitTime, updates MaxComboRecorded, fires OnComboChanged, and enables ticking while active.
- GetComboCount(): current combo count.
- GetTimeSinceLastHit(): seconds since the last hit; returns -1 if no hits recorded.

Delegates
- OnComboChanged(ComboComp, NewComboCount): fired on each increment.
- OnComboReset(ComboComp): fired when combo resets (timeout or explicit reset).

Tick/reset behavior
- Ticks only while ComboCount > 0.
- Each tick: if (Now - LastHitTime) >= ComboTimeout, ResetCombo() and fire OnComboReset.
- Resets disable ticking until next hit.

Integration points
- Hook RegisterHit from your damage or ability hit events (server). If you want client UI, replicate ComboCount and bind UI to a replicated event or RPC (current implementation is server-only; extend replication if needed).
- Optional: add gameplay tags when combo is active (not implemented by default). You can apply/remove a transient tag (e.g., Poly.State.ComboActive) on change/reset.
- Optional: trigger rewards at thresholds by binding to OnComboChanged and checking ComboCount (e.g., at 3/5/8).

Replication
- Current implementation does not replicate fields. To show combos on clients, replicate ComboCount (and optionally MaxComboRecorded) and fire events in OnRep; keep LastHitTime server-side and compute the countdown on the server.

Tuning
- ComboTimeout: adjust per character/instance.
- MinDamageThreshold: pass a value into RegisterHit if you want to ignore trivial hits.

Notes
- The component is stand-alone; it does not auto-attach to the ASC or modify damage executions. It expects you to call RegisterHit when a qualifying hit lands.
